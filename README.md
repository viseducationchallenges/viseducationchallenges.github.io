# Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Education: A Call to Action

This project is a call to action for research and discussion on data visualization education. As visualization evolves and
spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse
community of learners in visualization. 

Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. 

Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper—educators and researchers in data visualization—identify and
describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes 

* People,
* Goals & Assessment, 
* Environment, 
* Motivation, 
* Methods, 
* Materials, and 
* Change. 

Across these themes, we formulate 43 research
questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective
action items: 
* embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, 
* build COMMUNITIES, 
* conduct RESEARCH, 
* act AGILE, and 
* relish RESPONSIBILITY. 

We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we
educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges across many scales and many domains in a rapidly changing world.
